# ALX Low-Level Programming

This repository contains projects and tasks completed as part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. The projects cover various concepts and topics related to low-level programming in the C language, such as memory allocation, pointers, data structures, algorithms, and system calls.

The repository contains the following subdirectories:

## 0x00-hello_world

This directory contains introductory C programs, including a "Hello, World!" program and scripts to compile C code.

## 0x01-variables_if_else_while

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the use of variables, if/else statements, and loops.

## 0x02-functions_nested_loops

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the use of functions and nested loops.

## 0x03-debugging

This directory contains C programs that are intentionally broken and require debugging.

## 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops

This directory contains more advanced C programs that use functions and nested loops.

## 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the use of pointers, arrays, and strings.

## 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings

This directory contains more advanced C programs that use pointers, arrays, and strings.

## 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings

This directory contains even more advanced C programs that use pointers, arrays, and strings.

## 0x08-recursion

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate the use of recursion.

## 0x09-static_libraries

This directory contains C programs and scripts to create and use static libraries.

## 0x0A-argc_argv

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate how to use the `argc` and `argv` arguments in `main`.

## 0x0B-malloc_free

This directory contains C programs that demonstrate dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and `free`.

## 0x0C-more_malloc_free

This directory contains more advanced C programs that use dynamic memory allocation.
